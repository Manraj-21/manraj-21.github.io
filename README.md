This repo is home to my CMPT 276 Mini-Project.

My website is hosted [here](https://manraj-21.github.io/)

The purpose of this Mini-Project is to create a personal portfolio website, while getting practice using the tech stack that I will use in my final project (HTML, CSS, JS, React), as well as more practice using GitHub 

Here is the wireframe image I constructed using Figma
